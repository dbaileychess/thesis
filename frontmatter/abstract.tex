The following chapters detail improvements to the data acquisition methods used in mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Mass spectrometers were empowered to analyze spectral data in real-time and make informed decisions on how to proceed based on the results. Chapter 1 begins with an board overview of proteomics, mass spectrometry, and the data acquisition methods commonly used. The second chapter focuses on the instant sequencing (\inseq{}) algorithm developed to improve reproducibility, boost quantitative results, and localize more post-translational modifications (PTMs) in LC-MS/MS experiments. Chapter 3 introduces a novel real-time elution ordering algorithm (EOA) to target hundreds of peptides reproducibility. In chapter 4, two large software programs (COMPASS \& CSMSL), which handle large-scale data analysis, are presented. The final chapter suggest future improvements to IDA methods.
