The following chapters detail improvements made to the data acquisition methods used in mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Mass spectrometers were empowered to analyze spectral data in real-time and make informed decisions on how to proceed based on the results. Chapter 1 begins with an board overview of proteomics, mass spectrometry, and commonly used data acquisition methods. The second chapter focuses on the instant sequencing (\inseq{}) algorithm that improves reproducibility, boosts quantitative results, and localizes more post-translational modifications (PTMs) in LC-MS/MS experiments. Chapter 3 introduces a novel real-time elution ordering algorithm (EOA) to target hundreds of peptides across multiple LC-MS/MS experiments reproducibly. In chapter 4, two large software packages (COMPASS \& CSMSL), which handle large-scale data analysis, are presented. The final chapter suggests future improvements to further IDA methods.
